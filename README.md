# hello-world
A traditional milestone to learn Git

I initially created this git account to better manage my code.

As for everyone who came before me, so too did I find myself one day needing to safeguard a working version of a computer program while needing a clone of the code to work on upgrades.

Git seemed like the (only) right place to go :)
